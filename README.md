# Discuss

> A center for discussion and planning of the contain-rs organization.

## What's in this repo?

Documents pertaining to the management or code in contain-rs. This includes:

  - API motivations and guidelines
  - Conventions of all kinds
  - Global documentation
  - Motivation and plan for collections
  - Other important documents
  
New documents can be added via pull requests, which will prompt discussion
and possible acceptance. If a document is accepted, it's pull request can be
merged.

Note that not all collections need to have a full motivation and plan document,
they can be added later for collections which have specialized use profiles.

### Issues

`discuss` also has issues, where different ideas and long term goals can be
discussed before a full document is ready or if a full document is not
appropriate.
